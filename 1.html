  <p style="margin-top:45px"><u>[ Directions ]</u></p>

Some coarse red chili pepper powder (for garnish)
<br>1. Place half of the canned ham in a plastic bag and mash it with the palm of your hands. Slice the other half into 0.5cm-thick slices.
<br>2. Julienne the onion into 0.3cm-thick slices and finely slice the green onion into 0.5cm-thick slices.
<br>3. Slice the tofu into 1cm-thick slices.
<br>4. In a coated pan, add the mashed ham and place it over low heat. Stir-fry until the fat melts out and the ham turns golden brown.
<br>5. Add kimchi and raise the heat to medium heat. Continue stir-frying until the kimchi is fully cooked.
<br>6. Add the water, onion, sliced ham, minced garlic, soup soy sauce, coarse and fine red chili pepper powder, and saeujeot and bring to a boil over high heat.
<br><strong>*If you only have one type of red chili pepper powder, add 2 tbsp for coarse red chili pepper powder and 1 and 1/2 tbsp for fine red chili pepper powder.</strong>
<br><strong>*You can also add the onions in with the kimchi.</strong>
<br><strong>*If you don’t have saeujeot, you can replace it with sand lance fish sauce or tuna fish sauce.</strong>
<br>7. Once the jjigae comes to a boil, reduce to medium heat and cook for another 3 minutes.
<br>8. Pour the jjigae into a serving pot. Garnish with tofu, green onion, and coarse red chili pepper
<br><strong>*If you don’t have a serving pot, you can just serve it as is.</strong>
  <br><strong>*If you want a tarter flavor, add more vinegar to your liking.</strong>
<br><strong>*If the kimchi is too pungent, add some sugar.</strong>
